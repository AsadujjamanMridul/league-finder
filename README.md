# League Finder

This react project has been created using [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com)  api

## Overview
This is mainly a mockup website to see details about any sports league available worldwide. Viewers can see the League Info such as - league badge, date of foundation, country, sport type, and player's gender through this web app. One can also visit social accounts ([`twitter`](https://twitter.com), [`facebook`](https://facebook.com), [`youtube`](https://youtube.com)) of those leagues. 

Thanks to the TheSportsDB team, for such a lovely api.
